Throughout the school year, student organizations hold auditions for events. A typical situation involves multiple groups with multiple candidates, with the groups competing for the best candidates and the candidates competing for the best groups. Often time, what happens is that the leaders of these groups would all gather in one location to deliberate over absolutely all the preferences that have been expressed, with the goal of creating a set of matches that pleases as many people as possible. As you might expect, these meetings can take hours. 

Such a situation presents a good opportunity to apply some magical matching automation and that's what our application seeks to provide. There are, of course, matching programs out there for large-scale events such as college applications, but there doesn't seem to be a consumer-friendly matching app for smaller-scale events such as student group auditions. There's Google Calendar for personal time-management, When2Work for campus job shift-scheduling and WhenIsGood for meetings but nothing for group-applicant matching even though its sorely needed. That's where Matchery comes in.
